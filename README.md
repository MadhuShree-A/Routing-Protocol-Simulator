# Routing Protocol Simulator

https://routing-protocol-simulator.onrender.com

## Overview
This project implements a web-based simulation tool for routing protocols, allowing users to design custom network topologies and visualize routing tables generated by two classical algorithms:
- Link State Routing (OSPF – Dijkstra’s Algorithm)
- Distance Vector Routing (RIP – Bellman–Ford Algorithm)

The system provides an interactive topology builder and a separate results page that displays routing tables in a clear, readable format. The backend is built using Flask in Python, and the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and the Vis.js library for visualization.

## Features

### Topology Builder
- Interactive drag-and-drop interface built with Vis.js  
- Add routers by double-clicking  
- Add links by double-clicking two routers  
- Supports weighted links (user-defined cost)  
- Nodes remain fixed unless intentionally dragged  
- Clean undirected link representation (no arrows)

### Routing Algorithms
The project computes routing tables using:
1. **Link State Routing (OSPF)**  
   - Implemented using Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
   - Computes shortest paths based on full network knowledge  

2. **Distance Vector Routing (RIP)**  
   - Implemented using a corrected Bellman-Ford iterative neighbor-exchange process  
   - Simulates DV table updates based only on neighbor vectors  
   - Produces results independent from LS for complex topologies  

### Results Page
- Displays OSPF and RIP routing tables separately  
- Spacious card-based UI  
- Clear separation of routing protocols  
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes  
- Option to return to topology builder page

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Python  
- Flask  
- Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- Distance Vector (Bellman-Ford DV style)

### Frontend
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Vis.js for topology visualization

## How It Works

### 1. Build a Topology
Users create a network by interacting with the canvas:
- Double-click to add routers  
- Double-click two routers to add a weighted link  
- Edit or remove nodes/links as needed  

### 2. Simulate Routing
When the user submits the topology:
- Nodes and edges are sent to the Flask backend  
- The backend computes:
  - **ls_tables** using Dijkstra  
  - **dv_tables** using Distance Vector  
- Results are stored in session and redirected to the results page

### 3. View Results
The results page displays:
- Link State routing tables  
- Distance Vector routing tables

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the topology builder  
2. Add routers and weighted links  
3. Click "Simulate Routing"  
4. View routing tables on the results page  
5. Return to builder to modify or test alternative designs
